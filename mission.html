        <div id="mission">
          <p>The mission of the WCFFES is to celebrate the history and achievements of the Irish in the American Fire Services, while helping its members to become more connected with their roots through education, social events and genealogical research assistance. We welcome anyone with an interest in the history of the Fire Service or those who have an interest in strengthening the bonds between Ireland and Irish America. You don't have to be Irish or a Firefighter to join. We have members from all walks of life, with both uniformed and civilian divisions.</p>
          <p>In 2014, the WCFFES formed a Ceremonial Unit to provide assistance and guidance with special Fire Service events such as funerals, memorials, dedications and graduations. Trained by the elite FDNY Ceremonial Unit at Ft. Tottens, Queens, the Emerald Society Ceremonial Unit stands ready to assist any area fire, police or EMS department.</p>
